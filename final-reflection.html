    <p>
      At the beginning of this course, I envisioned my portfolio as a place to showcase my technical work and spiritual values.
      I wanted it to reflect who I am, not just as an IT professional, but as someone striving to live and lead as a disciple of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
      Now, as I look back on what I’ve built and experienced, I can see how much that vision has evolved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout this course, I’ve had many opportunities to reflect on what really drives me: service, integrity, and continuous growth.
      My spiritual portfolio captures the values and scriptures that help to ground me, while my professional portfolio helps pain a picture of how 
      I apply those values in real-world IT scenarios.  Each project description connects my technical efforts to a higher purpose, solving 
      problems ethically, mentoring others, and using technology in ways that lift and support.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the biggest shifts I have seen in me was recognizing that my professional growth isn’t just about certifications or skills, it’s 
      about who I become in the process.  I now view leadership not as a title, but as an opportunity to serve.
      This perspective has helped to reshaped how I interact with colleagues, how I mentor newer staff, and how I think about my long-term goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      My portfolio will continue to serve as a living document.  I plan to update it with new projects and spiritual reflections, 
      using it as a way to measure progress, not just in IT milestones, but in my journey as a disciple of Jesus Christ.
      It’s more than a showcase; it’s a commitment to my continued spiritual and professional growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, this course has helped me better align my professional and spiritual paths.
      The integration is far from perfect, but it’s improving. 
      That’s what I plan to carry forward: continual improvement, service, and the drive to keep learning and growing.
