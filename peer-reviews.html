    <h1>Portfolio Peer Review Summary</h1>

    <p>I participated in two peer reviews as part of the Week 6 assignment. For both, I provided detailed feedback focused on content clarity, visual organization, alignment to spiritual and professional goals, and technical depth.</p>

 <section>
  <h2>Feedback (Peer Review 1 – Chakanyuka)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I complimented the integration of faith and technical work, especially the inclusion of spiritual reflections in each project.</li>
    <li>I provided suggestions to break up long text blocks into bullet points and to add more visuals to improve readability.</li>
    <li>I shared how I was personally inspired by the principle “Service Brings Strength” and the practice of praying before technical tasks.</li>
    <li>I asked how spiritual guiding principles influence decision-making during high-pressure scenarios like security incidents.</li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h2>Feedback (Peer Review 2 – Roberto)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I complimented the portfolio’s organization and how well it tied spiritual reflections to career experiences.</li>
    <li>I noted that the layout was clean and that his personal values came through clearly in the content.</li>
    <li>I shared how his thoughts on trusting the Lord’s timing reminded me to be more intentional about involving Heavenly Father in my work and planning.</li>
    <li>I suggested adding visuals or screenshots to break up the text and including more detail on project tools to help highlight technical skills.</li>
    <li>I asked how he stays spiritually grounded in a fast-paced work setting where it’s easy to lose focus on those principles.</li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h2>Implementation Summary (Based on Peer Reviews)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I revised some of my reflection content to break up longer paragraphs using headings and bullet points for better readability, especially on mobile.</li>
    <li>I clarified technical tools and decisions in my project summaries to better highlight my contributions, even though I didn’t add external files or screenshots at this time.</li>
    <li>I reviewed all internal links to ensure they work consistently and considered a central folder for documents as a future enhancement.</li>
    <li>I made a small addition to my ethical reflection, noting that quarterly privileged access audits are a more realistic cadence for smaller IT teams.</li>
  </ul>
