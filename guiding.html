      <h2>Growth Through Adversity</h2>
      <p>I’ve learned that adversity is not just a part of life—it’s a key component of growth. This principle has shown up in both my spiritual journey and my IT career. Whether it's troubleshooting complex system failures or facing unexpected leadership challenges, I've found that meaningful progress often comes on the other side of difficulty. Spiritually, I've come to understand that trials are tools in the Lord’s hands to refine me, not punish me. Professionally, I’ve grown most when things haven’t gone smoothly—those are the times that stretch me, teach me humility, and help me rely more on the Savior.</p>

      <h2>Humility Leads to Strength</h2>
      <p>I used to see asking for help as a sign of weakness. But over time, I’ve come to realize that humility is the gateway to real strength—spiritually and professionally. In systems administration, I’ve learned that I don’t always have the answers, and turning to teammates or learning communities makes me better. In spiritual matters, when I turn to the Lord and admit I can’t do it alone, I feel more capable and grounded. Humility has made me more teachable, more collaborative, and more open to inspiration.</p>

        <li>Ether 12:27 – Weakness becoming strength through humility</li>
        <li>Proverbs 3:5–6 – Trust in the Lord</li>

      <h2>Discipleship is Whole-Hearted Work</h2>
      <p>True discipleship isn’t just about doing good things—it’s about becoming something better. Whether I’m managing servers or mentoring a teammate, I’ve come to see my work as a form of discipleship. I want to bring not just my skills but also my heart into every project. When I serve with intention, lead with empathy, and act with integrity, I feel like I’m becoming more of who the Lord wants me to be. This principle reminds me to give my best—not because it's expected, but because it's who I’m striving to become.</p>
