      <h2>File Server Migration</h2>
      <p>This project involved migrating a large dataset from legacy infrastructure to a secure, modern file system using PowerShell and Robocopy. I implemented logging, error checking, and planned departmental coordination to reduce downtime. Spiritually, this reflected my value of integrity and stewardship—handling sensitive systems with care and follow-through.</p>

      <h2>Automated Account Provisioning</h2>
      <p>Through PowerShell and SQL, I created automated processes to manage user accounts based on dynamic enrollment data. Previously done manually, this process now runs daily and saves extensive labor hours. It also mirrors the principle of diligent effort in solving meaningful problems with lasting impact.</p>

      <h2>Security Monitoring Implementation</h2>
      <p>I implemented a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to proactively monitor logs and detect anomalies across critical infrastructure. This included setting up alerting, log retention, and dashboards to support incident response. Spiritually, this project deepened my sense of vigilance and responsibility—watching over systems the way one might watch over others with care and diligence.</p>
