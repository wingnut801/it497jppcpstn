      <h2>Analysis of an Ethical Dilemma</h2>
      <p>A few years ago, a technician misused elevated privileges by granting unauthorized access to another users information. This action exposed sensitive, work-related files that included personally identifiable information (PII) and violated policy boundaries. The technician had no valid reason to access the device, as it was outside their assigned responsibilities.</p>
      <p>The organization responded swiftly by suspending the technician's access, conducting a full audit of privileged accounts, and reinforcing acceptable use and access policies. The individual ultimately resigned during the investigation process.</p>
      <p>This experience reinforced several key lessons: privileged access must be guarded with integrity; transparency and accountability are essential to ethical IT practice; and leaders must create environments where ethical boundaries are respected. It reaffirmed my own commitment to consent-based support, responsible stewardship of access, and professionalism in elevated roles.</p>
