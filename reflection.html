      <h2>Spiritual and Professional Growth</h2>
      <p>As I’ve worked on this portfolio, I’ve come to see how deeply connected my faith is to my work in technology. Each project I’ve undertaken, each challenge I’ve faced, and each solution I’ve implemented has not only taught me something technical but has also stretched me spiritually. When I pause to reflect, I realize that my work has become a proving ground for my discipleship.</p>
      <p>One insight that has come clearly through this process is that spiritual growth doesn't happen in isolation—it happens while we're doing, building, serving, and sometimes failing. In the moments when a server doesn’t behave, when a task seems too big, or when the pressure mounts, I’ve learned to lean on the Lord. That habit has shaped me more than any certification or training program. It has brought peace to my work and purpose to my progress.</p>
      <p>This journey has taught me that who I become through my work matters just as much as the outcomes I deliver. By staying grounded in gospel principles like humility, service, and perseverance, I am becoming the kind of disciple leader I hope to be—not just in my job, but in every area of my life.</p>

      <h2>Spiritual Insights That Have Guided Me</h2>
      <div class="spiritual-reflection">
      <h3>1. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17" target="_blank">Mosiah 2:17</a> – “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings...”</h3>
      <p>This verse reminds me that my work in IT can be spiritual when I approach it as service.  Every time I help someone solve a problem or recover lost data, I’m not just fixing tech, I’m serving a person.</p>

     <h3>2. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41-42" target="_blank">Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–42</a> – Leadership with gentleness and love</h3>
      <p>This scripture reminds me to lead with patience, especially in moments of frustration.  IT work often involves guiding others through stressful issues, and doing so with kindness has deepened my ability to lead.</p>

      <h3>3. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/05/quick-to-observe" target="_blank">Elder David A. Bednar – “Quick to Observe”</a></h3>
    <p>This talk taught me to notice small spiritual and technical signals.  Just as I watch for red flags in systems, I can watch for spiritual impressions. Being alert has helped me make better decisions on both fronts.</p>

    <h3>4. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" target="_blank">Matthew 25:40</a> – “Ye have done it unto me”</h3>
    <p>Even mundane tasks matter.  This verse helps me remember that my smallest acts of integrity and effort are noticed by the Lord.</p>

    <h3>5. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2005/10/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear" target="_blank">Gordon B. Hinckley – “If Ye Are Prepared Ye Shall Not Fear”</a></h3>
    <p>This has been a guiding principle in both my life and my work.  Preparation gives me confidence—whether I’m patching a system, presenting a portfolio, or trying to live a faithful life.</p>
